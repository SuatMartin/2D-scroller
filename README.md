# 2D-scroller
Game creation project

Current ideas to implement:
1. Multiple levels with a boss at the end, swaps levels after winning
2. in-game cutscenes with text boxes
3. make at least 4 different types of generic enemies, normal shooter, tanky shooter, remote controlled, laser(unpariable)
4. looping music
5. Main and Pause menu
6. 2 attacks per boss minimum
